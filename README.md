# coding-challenges
This repo houses a set of coding challenges.

### Testing

Each challenge from the `src/` directory has a corresponding file in the `test/` directory.

To get started, you'll need to run `npm install` from the command line. This is installing the dependencies listed in your `package.json`. At the moment, we're installing mocha, chai, and nyc.

To run the tests, run `npm test` from your command line. If you just forked this project, you'll see that 1 test is passing with 25% coverage. (NOTE: This is only passing because no assertions are included in the test, therefore none can fail. If you read it, it's obviously not a valid test.)

Your task will be to write the remainder of the tests. We're going to use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) for this. [NYC](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) is running the code coverage numbers. Take a look through their documentation.

I've started some of the scaffolding in `nonrepeated-character.test.js` for you. You'll also notice the line at the bottom of `nonrepeated-character.js`. You'll need to understand what this code is doing, and use it in your other files as well. //TODO - Add wiki blog about module.exports

I've also provided solutions to each of the coding challenges in the `src/` directory. Feel free to delete these and include your solutions instead. The solutions are just *ONE* solution that I've provided; there are many other correct ones.

### package.json


### NPM and NPM Scripts

### module.exports
